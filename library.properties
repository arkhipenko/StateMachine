sentence=Lightweight table-driven state machine framework built on TaskScheduler.
paragraph=Provides cooperative multitasking state machines with three core abstractions: smAction (state behavior with onEnter/onRun/onExit lifecycle), smState (action wrapper with TaskScheduler integration), and smMachine (transition orchestrator using table-driven {fromState, exitCode, toState} transitions). Supports device abstraction via smDevice interface, configurable execution intervals, and standard exit codes for common conditions.
